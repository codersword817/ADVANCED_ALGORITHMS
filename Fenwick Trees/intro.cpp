/*
Fenwick Trees => BIT - Binary Indexed Trees 

Generally used to solve range query problems 
but why? we have prefix sum which can compute in O(1) time 
but what if there is a dynamic change in elements after each query (will you uild each time taking n time to pre-compute )


Use-Cases:
Range Calculations
    Range sum, Range Max, Range Min, Range XOR 

Applications:
Inversion count
